# Corpcolo - I used to work with them for 2 years


### I would like to share some scripts they may help somebody
1. [A script which helps me to configure cabinet switches](/cabinetswitches)
2. [A script which helps me configure ipmi](/ipmi)
3. [A simple library which snds emails via GMail](https://github.com/efimlosev/corpcolo/blob/master/emailsend.py)
# Plans
* Write a single script instead of bunch of script
* Implement config files based on YAML language
